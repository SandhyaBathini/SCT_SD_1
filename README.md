This project, titled “Temperature Converter GUI”, is developed as part of my Software Development Internship at SkillCraft Technology.
The objective of this task is to design and implement a program that allows users to convert temperatures between the three most commonly used scales — Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

The program is built entirely in Java using the Swing framework to provide a simple, clean, and user-friendly graphical interface.
It enables users to input a temperature value, select the input and output scales, and view the converted result instantly with precision and clarity.

This project demonstrates my understanding of object-oriented programming, GUI development, event handling, and basic arithmetic conversions, forming a strong foundation for more complex software engineering tasks in future SkillCraft modules.
Key Features
🔹 Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin temperature scales.

🔹 Built with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java Swing for enhanced user experience.

🔹 Interactive and user-driven — allows users to select input/output units and enter values dynamically.

🔹 Error handling for invalid or non-numeric inputs using message dialogs.

🔹 Lightweight and portable, requiring only Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to execute.

🔹 Displays the result up to two decimal points for accuracy.
